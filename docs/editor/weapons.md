### Abstract

In a lot of video games, the main character has a weapon. This is one way to interact with the world! "Weapon" can mean a gun, an axe, or even a tomato grenade. Programming a weapon can be the most complicated part of making a game, but to make that easier, Core comes with a built-in weapon system!

In Core, a "weapon" is a type of object that can be created in a Core project. When a player picks up or "equips" a weapon object, the player is instantly able to use that weapon! So to create something like a rifle, all that needs to be done is to spawn a weapon, modify the settings for how far the weapon can shoot, and equip it to a player! 

!!! info
    A weapon can be anything imaginable that the player holds and uses to interact with the world.

### Tutorial

Adding a weapon to a game is a couple more steps than just spawn, modify, and equip. The tutorial below will walk you through the process from an empty project, to using a gun of your own making in a level!

In this tutorial, we will be adding a basic gun, a shotgun, to an empty project.

1. Make gun
