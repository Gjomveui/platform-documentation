### Abstract

*page in progress*

In a lot of video games, the main character has a weapon. This is one way to interact with the world! "Weapon" can mean a gun, an axe, or even a tomato grenade. 
Programming a weapon can be the most complicated part of making a game, but to make that easier, Core comes with a built-in weapon system!

In Core, a "weapon" is an *equipment* type of object that can be created in a Core project. When a player picks up or "equips" a weapon object, the player is instantly able to use that weapon! 
So to create something like a rifle, all that needs to be done is to spawn a weapon, modify the settings for how far the weapon can shoot, and equip it to a player.

!!! info
    A weapon can be anything imaginable that the player holds and uses to interact with the world.

### Tutorial

Adding a weapon to a game is a couple more steps than just spawn, modify, and equip. The tutorial below will walk you through the process from an empty project, to using a gun of your own making in a level!

This gun will be placed in the world and the player will need to pick it up to use it.

In this tutorial, we will be adding a really simple gun to an empty project.

1. Make gun
2. Make a trigger
3. Make a script
4. reference the trigger and gun
5. equip the weapon when player does interact
6. make functions to turn on and off collision when weapon is picked up
7. connect all events
8. test it out bro!

A second example will show how to have a player start with a specific weapon equipped.

### Examples

*Garden Warfare* includes several weapons used in various ways.
