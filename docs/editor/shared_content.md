Template/Shared Content updating details:
- instantiating template keeps custom properties to user
- script changes propagate from owner to user, stomping changes
- new instances use owner's changes
- update template from this (with instantiated one stomps owner's changes)
- non-custom props (e.g. guns?), do they follow these same rules?
