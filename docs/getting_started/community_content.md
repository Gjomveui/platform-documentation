# Community Content

**Community Content** is one of the most fundamentally awesome aspects of
creation in Core. It allows for you to use, improve, and remix creations you or
others have made public in order to create a wealth of content for all game
creators on the platform - speeding up game development & the spread of ideas more than ever before!

With that in mind, here's how to best use it.

## Using Community Content: Downloading Content

Community Content exists as a free exchange of creations, both of models & art, as well as programming & game logic. All sorts of things can be found here, made by users just like you. 

The goal is to bring your ideas to life as fast as possible, so that nothing stands between you and sharing your mind with the world! Building on top of what others have done before you leaves room to come up with even more new ideas and focus on what really speaks to you.

Open up the **Community Content** tab by clicking on it. If the tab isn't already open for you, navigate to `View -> Community Content` in the top menu bar to open the window.

Here you can browse the content or search by username or key words. 

Click the blue `+` button on an asset to import the template. It will likely ask you to save your project first.

You can then see the template you chose in your own **Project Content** folder.
`Project Content -> Imported Content`.

### Using Your Imported Content

From within the Imported Content section, you will find any and all templates that you download from Community Content. 

When selecting a template from the menu on the left, the contents of that template will show up on the right. This will list all the parts of a template including scripts, visual effects, and materials. 

The green object is the main template, and the part you should drag into the Hierarchy or viewport for use.
