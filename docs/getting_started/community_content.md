# Community Content

Shared content is one of the most fundamentally important aspects of game
creation in Core. It allows for you to use, improve, and remix creations you or
others have made public in order to create a wealth of content for all game
creators on the platform - speeding up game development more than ever before.
With that in mind, here's how to use it.

## Using Community Content

Open up the `Community Content` tab (go to `View -> Community Content` to open the
window if you don't see it already).

Here you can browse the content or search (by username or template name).

Press the `+` button to import the template, and then you can see it in your
`Asset Manifest -> Project Content -> Imported Community Content`.

!!! Note
    To see sub-content brought along by each template, click on each element in
    the expanded category of imported community content.

## Importing A New Map

- Go to `Object -> Remove Old Sky`
- Go to community content and import `ForestArena`
- Go to Project Content and drag the template into the 3D Viewport or the Hierarchy
- Run around the fancy level, examine it in the hierarchy to see how it was
  constructed, etc.

## Importing New Game Logic

- Go to community content and import `FFA_GameMode`
  - Like before, it has to be dragged into the hierarchy
- Check out the READ_ME for details, or just play around

Optionally, add weapons via `FFA_Spawners` and you have a full game mode!

!!! Warning
    This is not a perfect example, it is outdated and doesn't follow all the
    best practices - it is simply included as inspiration for if you need some
    direction; don't follow it exactly.

## Next Steps

Feel free to publish the game and play with others (save the map, exit to the
main menu, and click on the game, choose publish, and then go to the site
[[staging](https://staging.manticoreplatform.com)/[production](https://prod.manticoreplatform.com)])

Browse [examples](/reference/examples), download them, and play around with everything!
