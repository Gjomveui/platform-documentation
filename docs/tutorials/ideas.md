challenge with incomplete templates as learning tutorial

I'd love to organize a "gameprov" at conventions or on Twitch, where the
audience shouts out suggestions for games and someone makes them in core in real
time - could be a cool challenge

Let users organize their own challenges, similar to how itch.io has tons of game
jams active at all times
