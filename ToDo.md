  - [ ] Custom colors
  - [ ] Custom layout
  - [ ] Integrate build into this repo
- [X] Contribution guidelines
- [ ] Discuss licensing
- [ ] [MkDocs Plus Reference](http://bwmarrin.github.io/MkDocsPlus)
- [ ] `Recommonmark` as a way to do Sphinx _and_ MD in the same project
- [ ] ReadTheDocs vs Netlify (versioning, domains, etc - all different)
- [ ] Better way to link/reference with images with relative links, size of
  image details, etc.
- [ ] Edit URI using correct branch
- [ ] Change examples to use sortable table (and style it too if needed)
- [ ] Fix broken emojis
