# Troubleshooting

- AntiVirus software sometimes protect the `My Documents` folder.
    - Symptoms: The user can log in and launch the client by clicking a game on the web, but the game doesn't load and drops the user back to the client frontend.
    - Workaround: Disable any "Safe Files" or "Folder Protection" options in your AntiVirus software.
- Windows 7: It's an SSL issue.
    - Symptoms: The launcher can't communicate with the backend. Press <kbd>TAB</kbdA> in the Launcher and it will show a log file.
    - Workaround: We're working on it. Otherwise upgrading to Windows 10 would help.
- Time Travelling. Or just a wrong clock setting.
    - Symptoms: The user is dropped to the client frontend, but none of the above is the issue.
    - Workaround: Check your clock and date and make sure it is correct.
- More power.
    - Symptoms: The launcher is stuck on "Checking Registry..."
    - Workaround: Start the launcher as the admin user.
