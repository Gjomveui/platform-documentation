## Setup & Installation

If you haven't downloaded CORE yet, time to download our installer from
[here](https://mantiblob.blob.core.windows.net/builds/CoreLauncherInstall.exe) and then run it.

## Launcher

Now you'll have a new icon in your startmenu, CORE Launcher. If you want to start working on a project, launching CORE directly is the way to go, if you want to play games others made, you just head to [manticoreplatform.com](https://prod.manticoreplatform.com) and hit "Play" on any game you like. Your browser will prompt you to open CORE, you hit okay and CORE will directly into the game.

## Editor

If you decide to work on something new, you start the Editor directly via CORE Launcher. When you open up the editor you'll see the following screen:

1. CORE! You made it to the right place
2. Character - click on this to go to the avatar customization page page
3. Create - Where games directly authored by you live
4. Games - this is just a link to [manticoreplatform.com](https://prod.manticoreplatform.com) for now
5. Discord - A link to the CORE Creators community Discord
6. Feedback - A link to a form to submit feedback
7. User Dropdown - Here you can log out or exit CORE.

Now to create a new project, click on the big "Create New" button, select "Empty Project" and give it a name. Now you're in the Editor!

![EditorIntro](../img/EditorManual/Platform_2019-12-02_12-27-58.png "The various parts of the editor"){: .center}

1. Toolbar (Undo, Redo, Move, Rotate, Scale, Snap To Grid, Grid Size, World/Local
     Space, Performance View ... Play, Pause, Multiplayer ... Editor Settings)
2. Main Viewport
3. Asset Manifest (Project Content, CORE Content, Community Library
4. Hierarchy
5. Properties
6. Terrain Editor

We'll go over each in more depth in their respective sections.

The best way to start is by making a map. Then we'll add functionality with a simple game. Lastly, we'll see how using Communiy content can expedite this
entire process. The editor is divided into different windows or "views" which have distinct roles. If you close a view, you can re-open it via the drop-down toolbar at the top left of the screen.

We will now briefly walk through several of those views!

### Toolbar

### Viewport

### Asset Manifest

Within the asset manifest you can select an asset type from the drop down menu, then press the "+" icon to expand the different categories within that type. These categories include all assets provided by CORE.

#### Community Content

To access assets created by other creators, open the "Community Content" view. You can browse content based on a variety of search criteria. These shareable content items are called "templates" and may include scripts, visuals, or even complete games.

To learn more about templates, including how to make your own to share, checkout our [template guide](../tutorials/gameplay/collaboration_reference.md).

### Hierarchy

The Hierarchy view includes all of the objects in your game. If you add an object, for example a Trigger, it will appear here.

### Properties

The Properties window is where all the details of a selected object can be found, and changed. Things like world position and visibility can be altered here.
