### Setup/Installation

If you haven't downloaded the editor, go
[here](https://mantiblob.blob.core.windows.net/builds/Launcher.zip) and extract
the file into its own directory.

Next, simply click on `PlatformLauncher.exe` and you will see Core start up!

### Editor

When you open up the editor you'll see the following screen:

![](/img/getting_started/Start_01.png)

1. Core! You made it to the right place
2. User info - click on this to go to the avatar page
3. User settings - change your editor settings here
4. My Games - Where games directly authored by you live
5. Collaborations - Games you download or don't own entirely will live in this row
6. Exit - On the off chance you want to leave the program

We can ignore most everything (you can change your avatar if you are so
inclined); instead let's make a new map.

Click on the button to create a new map, put your name here, and then you'll
load in. You may have to allow it through the firewall, do so, and then you'll
see the next screen:

![](/img/getting_started/Start_02.png)

1. Toolbar (Undo, Redo, Move, Rotate, Scale, Snap To Grid, Grid Size, World/Local
     Space, Performance View ... Play, Pause, Multiplayer ... Editor Settings)
2. Main Viewport
3. Asset Manifest (Project Content, Shared Content, Content Library (3D Text,
   Audio, ...), New Script)
4. Hierarchy
5. Properties
6. Event Log (replacing Terrain Editor)

We'll go over each in more depth in their respective sections.

The best way to start is by making a map. Then we'll add functionality with a
simple game. Lastly, we'll see how using shared content can expedite this
entire process.
