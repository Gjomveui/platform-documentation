# Community Content

**Community Content** is one of the most fundamentally awesome aspects of
creation in COREâ„¢. It allows for you to use, improve, and remix creations you or
others have made public. This creates a wealth of content for all game
creators on the platform - speeding up game development & the spread of ideas more than ever before!

With that in mind, here's how to best use it.

## Using Community Content: Downloading Content

Community Content exists as a free exchange of creations, both of models & art, as well as programming & game logic. All sorts of things can be found here, made by users just like you.

The goal is to bring your ideas to life as fast as possible, so that nothing stands between you and sharing your mind with the world! Building on top of what others have done before you leaves room to come up with even more new ideas and focus on what really speaks to you.

Open up the **Community Content** tab by clicking on it. If the tab isn't already open for you, navigate to `View -> Community Content` in the top menu bar to open the window.

Here you can browse the content or search by username or key words.

Click the blue `+` button on an asset to import the template. It will likely ask you to save your project first.

You can then see the template you chose in your own **Project Content** folder.
`Project Content -> Imported Content`.

### Using Your Imported Content

From within the Imported Content section, you will find any and all templates that you download from Community Content.

When selecting a template from the menu on the left, the contents of that template will show up on the right. This will list all the parts of a template including scripts, visual effects, and materials.

The green object is the main template, and the part you should drag into the Hierarchy or viewport for use.

## Next Steps: Publish Your Own Content

To learn more about these templates that are shared on Community Content, and how to share your own with the world of CORE, follow our quick tutorial on [Templates](/Tutorials/Templates.md).

Feel more than free to download as many Community Content templates as you can! Getting help to create your vision can be as easy as searching for what you seek.

## Remixing Games: Starting from an Existing Game

Another way to speed ahead the creation of your project is to **start with an entire game that somebody else has made.**

Some games published on the CORE website allow other users to download them, enabling you to move things around and change the game however you would like.

To download a game by somebody else and add your own personal flair, go to the game's page on our website. If the person who published the game allowed it to be publicly editable, then there will be an `Edit` button on the page. Clicking this will download the whole game project to your computer, allowing you to open it up and edit it from within the CORE editor!
