# Frequently Asked Questions

## CONFIDENTIALITY

* While you cannot share screenshots or videos of the CORE Editor or the games you make in them publicly, you can share them in the CORE Discord channels

## GETTING STARTED WITH CORE

* **Join the CORE Alpha [DISCORD SERVER!](https://discord.gg/85k8A7V)** - This will be the best place to get the latest updates, news, events, and help from both the CORE Alpha Team and the Alpha community.
* **Check out the [GETTING STARTED](https://www.coregames.com/docs/getting_started/editor_intro/) section of the [CORE CREATORS' HUB](https://www.coregames.com/docs/)** - Here you'll find an overview of the editor, a tutorial on making your first game, and how to share and use shared content within CORE

## ALPHA ACCESS

> **Q:** So is the alpha something we're going to have perpetual access to now that we're in or is it planned that we're going to lose access at some point?

> **A:** There will likely be some down time between closed Alpha and closed Beta, but we aren't sure how much yet - it will partially depend on how stable the alpha is and if we need to make any major changes between alpha and beta

## CHAT & COMMS

> **Q:** Will stuff like the built in chat be editable for users? like if someone wanted to change something about it for their specific game?

> **A:** In-game text chat will happen sometime during Alpha. We won't have voice chat to start but we can of course use discord!

## CORE CONTENT

> **Q:** One thing I'm unclear on, are the things made in CORE meant to stay within the confines of the community content, or can it build to other platforms as well?

> **A:** Stuff made in CORE is meant to be used on the CORE platform, but 100% sharable across the platform if you so desire. In my stream on monday I will show off how easy it is to copy/paste content from one game to another….

> Want the helicopters from Sniper Alley in Spellshock? Crtl-C, Ctrl-V, done!

---
> **Q:** Are maps the equivalent of scenes in unity?

> **A:**  Sort of - I should actually say "Games" instead of "maps" - we don't have a separate scene concept yet

> Scenes is definitely something we want to add in the future

---

> **Q:** One of the demos I saw you could transition people to other maps, so I guess that could be a workaround if you wanted multiple levels?

> **A:** Yes, correct!  You could even build an zone style 'MMO' that way if you really wanted to (well, not in Alpha, but eventually)

> we will have the portal technology in alpha, but no way to pass data from one game/zone to the other

---
> **Q:** I really like the seamless game changing. Is that limited to maps that only the creator made? Or could i, for example, make a "hub" that has a curated list of games I like?

> **A:** You could indeed make a hub world that has portals to all the games you like!

> What's super cool about the Hub world is you'd be able to have all your friends join you and follow you from it into each game. Hopefully eventually creators team up to have links back to the most popular hubs etc and it all becomes one cool connected meta-verse

---
> **Q:** Can you lock your content from not being shared?
> **A:** Yes you choose to share

---
> **Q:** Is all the content/assets premade?
> **A:** At the very base level the answer is 'yes' - we provide all the base 3D objects, materials, sounds, vfx, etc. however - users can then 'kitbash' them together to make whatever they want and share that with each other if they choose via Community Content
---
> **Q:** Can we import custom assets?
> **A:** No, and there are a few reasons for that - the biggest one being: because all the content is built in to the client, when you share something with someone else, or copy/paste something from one game to another - we can guarantee that those assets are on the other persons computer already - so the only thing that gets shared is a small definition file of what assets are where, with what material, etc.

> in fact, entire games in core are a collection of these definition files, which means entire games are only a few hundred k which is why they load basically instantaneously

---
> A lot of stuff in CORE is about finding new and creative ways to use things that are at first maybe "non-obvious" but once you get the hang of it, it becomes really really fun

> Here is a prime example - this Palm Tree in the Pirate game is actually (as you can see in the hierarchy) 2 Ferns on top of 2 tear drop shapes

![Palm Tree](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/651152898113142807/653639807678939156/unknown.png)

> Here is a set of "retro" kitchen appliances our UI/UX guy was able to make in core - basically from primitives

![Retro Kitchen Appliances](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/651152898113142807/653641615490940928/unknown.png)

> And since he shared these in "Community Content" (a tab in the editor) - all creators have access to grab them and use them

> Here is another example of something I just grabbed from community content

![Marble Mausoleum](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/651152898113142807/653642303872696320/unknown.png)

> A cool marble mausoleum - the gates open and everything

> so not only is this a cool set-piece, it comes with the scripts needed to make it function

> And don't worry - we have yet to find anything that cannot be made in core using this methodc even all our Guns in our shooter games are made from 'gun parts' so you can totally make your own weapons if you want to

---
> **Q:** Oh there's community content? so anyone can create content - moderated by the core team?
> **A:** Yes, anyone can create content in CORE and share it with the community - it will be moderated by Manticore and voted on by users

---
>> **Q:** Is it possible for custom environment objects like buildings?
>> **A:** Yes, absolutely, using the primitives, smart objects, and templates

## LUA

> **Q:** Does the lua scripting system support use of external editors?

> **A:** Yes we support external editors for Lua  We have a built-in stack frame debugger that allows you to set breakpoints, step into and over functions, and inspect variables

> Here is a screenshot of the built-in Lua debugger. I've paused execution and I am inspecting the script that handles zooming in my scope on the client - Don't worry if you are not a coder, you won't have to go this deep to make stuff in CORE - but if you want to, you can. That is what we mean by "opt-in complexity"

## CONTROL & INPUT

> **Q:** How much control do we have over keybindings?

> **A:** Current status:  Not all keys have keybinds currently and remapping is possible

## GAME MECHANICS

> **Q:** Can you make team based games?
> **A:** Yes absolutely. MORE ANSWER
---
> **Q:** Do I have to use player CORE avatars?
> **A:** No you can change the avatar representation [more info]

---
> **Q:** What if I don’t want my game to have mounts?
> **A:** You can disable mounts in your game as you want.



---

> **Q:** Can you attach things to your avatar?
> **A:** You can make full body costumes or change your avatar out for something you or someone else has built
---

## PERFORMANCE
> **Q:** How does kit bashing work with performance?
> **A:** xx


## ART

> **Q:** Will there be a tutorial for making custom materials and textures?
> **A:** Yes, we already have tutorials for that already.  Check out the [Custom Materials](https://www.coregames.com/docs/tutorials/art/custom_materials/) tutorial in our [Tutorials Section](https://www.coregames.com/docs/tutorials/)

## UI
## VFX
## TERRAIN & SKY

> **Q:** WIll CORE support terrain holes?
> **A:** Terrain is voxel based, so yes.  Holes, caves, whatever you like.



## AUDIO

[CORE AUDIO REFERENCE](https://www.coregames.com/docs/tutorials/art/audio_reference/)

> **Q:** Does the engine support real-time audio effects? For example, applying reverb to an audio listener when a character enters a large room.

> **A:** Yes, You can also dynamically adjust lots of things on audio clips besides normal post-effects. - our Audio guru is awesome, and he even made Music Construction Kits so you can dynamically adjust music and build up your own tracks from his pieces - I will show that off today in my stream with the Pirate music

> I have a script that dynamically sets volumes on the instruments at different times

>  And just like with our 3D objects and Materials, you can also 'kitbash' audio to do things it wasn't nesc. intended to do

> For instance, I wanted a creaking windmill sound - but I found if i pitched the wooden door opening sound down about 3 octaves and looped it it made a great creaky windmill

---
> **Q:** Also, will there be a time when downloading core will be like 100gb? Seems difficult to scale - can't say for sure until I see how the editor actually works. seems limiting at first glance but maybe not

> **A:** Hopefully not that huge (though that's like how big RDR2 was right? lol). I think currently it's a few gigs, maybe 3 at the most?

## MONETIZATION
## COLLABORATION

> **Q:** Can you use git to collaborate on CORE projects, or is there a another system used?

> **A:** Yes you can use git or svn or pretty much whatever you want. CORE projects are actually very small text files, so they work in git quite well and, if you make folders at the root of your scene hierarchy, those act as file partitions making collaboration even easier as it lessens the chance for collisions

> The one 'gotcha' right now is that you don't want your .git folder to be inside each individual map folder, as currently CORE doesn't ignore it and copies it everywhere, which gets big...

> So, you want to do one of two things.... make a repro of your entire maps folder, with each game as a subfolder -OR-  make a repro for each game, and put the actual project 1 level deeper however, we will be fixing this during alpha




---

> **Q:** I’m assuming you don’t want us to have public repos while CORE is still in alpha?

> **A:** That is correct.

## MISC


## What are the system requirements for CORE

At the beginning of Alpha, this minimal spec will allow you to check out CORE, though your mileage may vary when it comes to playing or developing complex projects. For Alpha, a modern gaming PC is recommended for the best early experience.

### **Minimum System Requirements**

* **CPU:** Intel Core i5-7400 or AMD equivalent
* **RAM:** 8 GB
* **GPU:** NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 Ti or AMD equivalent
* **OS:** Windows 10 64-bit

### **Recommended System Requirements**

* **CPU:** Intel Core i5-7400 or AMD equivalent
* **RAM:** 16 GB
* **GPU:** NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1660 Ti or AMD equivalent
* **OS:** Windows 10 64-bit

There are a number of planned optimizations during Alpha and beyond which will greatly improve performance on lower spec machines.

> **Q:** so i noticed in the system reqs it says you need a "NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 Ti or AMD equivalent" is it possible to use core without a fancy GPU like this?

> **A:** The specs for Alpha are likely higher than they will be for launch, as we haven't done all our optimizations yet
our VFX artist was working on a 900 series card for most of the project
