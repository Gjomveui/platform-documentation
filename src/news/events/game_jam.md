# The First Game Jam 

![Put The Image Here, Matt!](../img/FolderName/ImageName.png){: .center}
Join the Devs in the first ever CORE Jam! The Manticore team will be jamming alongside Alpha Creators the entire week. Out of all the eligible entries, one lucky participant will win an exclusive CORE Alpha hoodie-- limited edition apparel that will never be reprinted again. 

## Jam Theme: Welcome Home
Make something that can welcome new users to CORE. This can be a helpful script, a customizable environment, a super useful prop, or even a full game.
We'll be streaming guides and tutorials to help your jam all week. Check it out at [ManticoreTV](../manticoretv/).

## What can I make?
Anything! It just needs to be useful, fun, and/or inspiring. It can be a full game, or it can be a piece of a game: a script, a prop, a weapon, etc.

## How do I submit it?
For game components, publish your template to Community Content.
For games and experiences, publish your project publicly as “Open for Editing” which shares your game with the creator community. 

## How long is the jam?
* **Start:** Tuesday, December 17
* **End:** Monday, December 23, 11:59pm PST

## Is there a prize?
Top entries will be spotlighted on ManticoreTV's stream and on the Core Creators Hub. Additionally, all eligible entries will be entered into a drawing for an exclusive, limited edition CORE Alpha hoodie.
