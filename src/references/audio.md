# Audio in Core

## Overview

In Core, there is a massive, built-in library of high quality audio assets designed for beginner and advanced creators. There are plenty of sound effects, background music tracks, and instruments that encompass a wide variety of genres and moods. Audio assets come with powerful customizable properties that allow creators to create a wide variety of soundscapes for their creations.

Core handles many complexities dealing with audio. When a player performs an action such as jumping or running, sound effects (like grunts or footsteps) play by default. Also most sounds are dynamically produced, meaning creators do not have to worry about repeating sounds sounding monotonous and robotic. For example, the gunshot sounds will never sound the exact same every time and footstep sound effects also change depending on whether a character is running over water or brick.

Although Core has this pre-built audio functionality, creators still have the flexibility to use Lua scripting and the [Audio API](../api/audio.md) to make audio even more dynamic in their projects.

## Audio Objects

### Adding Audio to Core

Creators can find the available Audio objects inside the **Core Content** window. Core Content has a category named Audio with several sub-categories to find a specific type of sound. The Audio objects can be drag and dropped from the Core Content window into the scene or Hierarchy.
