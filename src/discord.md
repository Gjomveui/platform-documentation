# Discord

This Creator Discord is a place for the community to have a place to share their CORE creations, learn from each other, and hang out.
We can't wait to see what you create!

Here on the Creator Discord, you can...

* Join us for community events and share your CORE creations.
* Hangout and make new friends as you playtest together.
* Learn and get help in our support channels, such as `#lua-help`  and `#editor-help`.
